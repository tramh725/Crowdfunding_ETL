# Crowdfunding_ETL
For this project, I was tasked to gather and clean out datas, based on the knowledge that I have gained from the lessons, or from the external websites that was provided. That being, I was taught how to convert the dates, from the grocery lesson. How to merge dataframes by using the first website listed in the reference section below. As well as using the second website, to create a dataframe.
